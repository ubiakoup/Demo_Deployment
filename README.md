### CI/CD Implementation in AWS using Gitlab/Github, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline
**Scenario:**

A company specializing in online sales wants to automate the deployment of its web application to improve efficiency and reduce human errors. Currently, the deployment process is manual, leading to delays, frequent errors, and a lack of visibility into the state of production releases. To address these issues, the company decides to enlist an AWS Cloud Engineer to design and implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline on AWS.

**Objectives:**

Automate Continuous Integration (CI) to ensure that every code change is automatically tested and validated.
Automate Continuous Deployment (CD) to enable a smooth and uninterrupted deployment of the application to the production environment.
Ensure the security, scalability, and resilience of the CI/CD pipeline.
